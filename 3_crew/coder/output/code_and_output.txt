```python
# This program calculates the first 10,000 terms of the series: 
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and then multiplies the result by 4.

def calculate_series(terms):
    total = 0
    for n in range(terms):
        # Calculate the current term with alternating signs
        current_term = (-1)**n / (2 * n + 1)
        total += current_term
    # Multiply the total by 4 to get the desired result
    pi_approximation = total * 4
    return pi_approximation

# Calculate the first 10,000 terms
terms = 10000
result = calculate_series(terms)

# Print the result
print(f"The approximation of Pi after {terms} terms is: {result}")

# Saving the output to a text file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"The approximation of Pi after {terms} terms is: {result}\n")
```

When you run the above code, it will calculate the series and produce an output in the console, as well as save it to `output.txt`. The output file will include something like:

```
The approximation of Pi after 10000 terms is: 3.141492653590034
```

This indicates the computed approximation of Pi based on the first 10,000 terms of the series provided.
